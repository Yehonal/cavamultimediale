There are more than 40,000 books on deposit at the 
Library of Badia. The books are catalogued and 
stored in three rooms, with cataloguing by Author 
as well as by Title. The largest collections are in 
history, Theology, Law, and Italian Culture. But it 
is the Manuscript Archive which rightly stands in 
pride of place at Badia, with the two elegant, late 
eighteenth-century, Depositories holding more 
than 15,000 priceless parchments, the oldest dating 
back to 792AD, as well as a considerable number 
of paper documents. A complete catalogue of the 
paper documents is presently in the process of 
preparation, whilst a complete catalogue of the 
parchment documents is already existent. Among 
the most fabulous of these parchment documents 
being the ninth-century "Visigoth Bible", the elev-
enth-century Lombard "Codex Legum Langobar-
dorum", the eighth-century "Etymologiae di Isi-
doro", and the eleventh-century "Times of the 
Venerable Bede". Anotations by monks from Ba-
dia, on events that influenced both them and the 
world of their day, have since been compiled into 
the much-published "Cava Annals".  The Private 
Documents are ordered chronologically, held in 
secure boxes of a hundred and twenty at a time, in 
the Diplomat's Room. The Public Documents (of 
which more than seven hundred Papal or Bishops 
Bulls, along with Communications from Emperors, 
Kings and Feudal Lords exist) are held in a large 
Depository, organised by date. Research is facili-
tated by an eight volume Parchment Catalogue, 
compiled by monks in the nineteenth century, giv-
ing the location and outline detail of each parch-
ment. There are already nearly seventeen hundred 
of such parchments, dating from 792 to 1080 AD, 
catalogued in the " Codex Diplomaticus Cavensis".
