Known locally as the Church of St James, the 
Church of St Mary the Pious is the oldest church in 
the medieval town of Borgo degli Scacciaventi. It 
was founded by Muzio Vespone, on the decree of 
Bishop Francesco D'Aiello in 1410. Next to the 
church was a hospital run by the Parish of St Ar-
cangelo. Here the Council of the University of 
Cava used to meet. The front of the building was 
renovated in 1739. After the Second World War, 
the church was left in the care of the locally-
famous "Mamma Lucia" of Cava.
