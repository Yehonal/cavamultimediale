Fronting the Piazza Roma are the three arches of 
the old Verdi Theatre, now the home of the Town 
Hall of Cava. Built in 1878, it has undergone sig-
nificant enlargement over the intervening years. 
First a second floor was added, then it was en-
larged by the addition of an east wing which took 
over part of the old Tennis Club of Cava. On the 
walls of the Auditorium hang three large paintings 
by the well-known local painter Clementi Tafuri of 
Salerno, there are also two large showcases con-
taining Roman artefacts that have been found at 
various sites around the city.
