Traditionally, the Piazza Duomo was known as the 
"Piazza del Commercio" because, very probably, it 
developed as the main marketplace of Cava: in-
deed, you can still see evidence of use on the oc-
tagonal pillars of the porticoes of this part of the 
city. At the southwestern corner of the Piazza was 
built the Duomo and then later, the Archbishop's 
Palace. In 1865, the Piazza was re-levelled, re-
quiring that a large flight of steps be built leading 
up to the Duomo. At the same time was also built 
the "Dolphin Fountain" in the centre of the Piazza. 
1n the 1960s, the seventeenth century front of the 
Archbishop's palace was replaced by a new, mod-
ern façade.
