Following a meeting of all the townspeople on 25 June 1497, it is decided to de-
clare to the Monastery of Badia that the City of Cava chooses to have for itself the 
Episcopal rights of a Bishop, as the City is now one of “first order” in the eyes of 
its Aragonese overlords. The future of the pre-eminence of the Abbey at Badia is 
seriously challenged by this civic declaration.
