One of the worst outbreaks of the plague ever experienced on the Italian mainland. 
It was believed to have been brought by Spanish sailors from Sardinia, landing at 
Naples. It killed thousands in Cava. In a desperate attempt to halt the ravages of the 
disease, the last surviving priest led a pilgrimage to the Chapel that lay within the 
walls of the Castle of San Adiutore, overlooking the City. Here a mass was held 
and, within days, the ravages of the plague began to subside. From this time on, the 
City of Cava has traditionally held an annual Festa di Castello.
