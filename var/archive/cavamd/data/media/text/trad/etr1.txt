Among the many problems that struck Italy in 
1656, one of them was the plague. It is believed to 
have been introduced initially into Naples by 
Spanish sailors who had stopped to take on board 
provisions in Sardinia, where the plague had al-
ready arrived six years earlier, spreading on 
throughout the rest of Bourbon Italy. In Cava it 
turned into a real calamity, with thousands dying. 
In the period 20 May to 6 July 1656, one hundred 
and nine deaths were recorded. Pressures on land, 
along with fears of contamination meant that most 
were buried in fields away from churchyards, 
meanwhile the local population offered up prayers 
to the Saints for protection. The story goes of how, 
in desperation, a priest, followed by crowds of citi-
zens from Cava, made his way up to the Chapel of 
the Castle of San Adiutore to pray to the Saints. 
With the Sacred Host in his hand, he went to the 
four walls overlooking the City and blessed the 
people. Miraculously, the City was saved. To this 
day, the tradition remains, with the Procession up 
the hill to the Castle accompanied by a long se-
quence of cannonades in the afternoon. In the eve-
ning, this wonderful festival is accompanied by 
light and firework displays, finishing with a spec-
tacular ‘firing’ of the Castle.
