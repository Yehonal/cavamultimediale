The administrative district of Rotolo stretches from 
the old Brickworks, close to the Church of the Ma-
donna dell'Olmo, to Caliri, and is centred on the 
long, winding road that splits by the Villa De Lu-
cia. At this fork, one road heads north to San Pie-
tro, whilst the other goes east through the village of 
Rotolo to Casaburi and then to Dupino. Of note in 
this small country area of Cava, is the Church of 
San Giovanni, severely damaged in the earthquake 
of 23 November 1980.
