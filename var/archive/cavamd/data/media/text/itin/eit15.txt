The villages of Arcara, Marini and Alessia lie on 
the stretch of road that joins the Surdolo Bridge 
with the village of Santissima Quaranta. Arcara, 
that hosts a wonderful restaurant of the same name, 
is so called because of the arches of the old acque-
duct that once crossed the valley. Marini got its 
name from the inhabitants of Vietri sul Mare who 
used to flee to the safety of the local hills to escape 
the ravages of pirates. Meanwhile Alessia possibly 
got its name from the old word "alisio", meaning 
"strawberry-tree", and the other wild fruit that 
grows in abundance there and in the area of nearby 
San Liberatore.
