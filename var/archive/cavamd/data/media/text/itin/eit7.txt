The built-up area, between the villages of Santa 
Lucia and Pregiato, takes the same name as the 
Church of Sant'Anna all'Oliveto (literally, "of the 
Olive Grove") because of the numbers of small 
olive groves that once could be found there. They 
were used to complement, agriculturally, the local 
production of tobacco, which was (and for some, 
still is) the main income source. Ceramic produc-
tion has recently arrived from Vietri and other 
parts of Cava, whilst the production of string and 
rope still employs a number of people in the dis-
trict.
