San Arcangelo is built on the remains of an old 
Lombard village, lying at the foot of Monte Fines-
tra. Found by the side of the road, leading out of 
Cava toward the old town of Corpo di Cava and 
the Abbey of Badia, and surrounded by new hous-
ing, it still manages to retain its unique medieval 
flavour.
