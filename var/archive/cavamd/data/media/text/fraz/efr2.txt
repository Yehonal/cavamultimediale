Today, the Church of Santa Maria della Peschiera 
(literally, "of the Fishpond") remains closed, barely 
remembered by locals today. Situated in front of 
the Church of San Cesareo di Cava, it took its 
name from the local fountains and fish-tanks that 
were found among the remains of a Roman villa. 
This villa is believed to have belonged to a certain 
Quinto Cecilio Metelio, from which comes the 
name Metelliana (the traditional name for the area 
around Cava). The Church of Santa Maria della 
Peschiera, along with its neighbour San Cesareo, 
are both mentioned in a document, dated 942 AD, 
as belonging to the diocese of the Cathedral of 
Salerno.
