Following a visit in 1951 to the world-renowned 
sanctuary of "Our Lady of Lourdes" in France, it 
was the wish of a local priest, Don Salvatore Pol-
verino, to create a faithful reconstruction of the 
sanctuary here in Cava. On July 14, 1974 ("Bastille 
Day" in France), his dream was realised with the 
benediction of his work in the village of Annun-
ziata, Cava. The sanctuary was built without public 
cost by a local surveyor, Napoleone Marano and 
his son, Gianfranco, and was decorated by copies 
of the statues of San Giuseppe, the Virgin Mary, 
and Santa Bernadette at Lourdes. However, it 
lacked a vital element, water, but thanks to the 
skills of a certain priest, Nicola Serra, a spring was 
magically divined gushing only a few metres from 
the sanctuary. The sanctuary is still the meeting 
place for pilgrims and tourists from all over Italy.
