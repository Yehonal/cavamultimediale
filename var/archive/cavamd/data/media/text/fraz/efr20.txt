In 1618, a convent for a Closed Order of nuns was 
established in the village of Pregiato. Today, 
nothing remains of the Convent but part of the 
cloisters and the recently restored Church of Santa 
Maria della Consolazione. Though continually suf-
fering from the depredations of thieves, the Church 
still retains some outstanding decoration, including 
its flooring and fixtures of wood inlay. Until some 
time ago, there also existed the "ruota", a small 
portal that allowed the nuns inside to communicate 
with the outside world. The Baroque main door-
way, in grey tufo stone, dated 1687, is another 
beautiful example of the work of local stonema-
sons. Next to the sixteenth century doorway to the 
Convent's church there is an alleyway that leads to 
a collection of old houses that still maintain their 
original layout of steps, courtyards, and effigies of 
saints. The area is still called "Salsano" after a lo-
cal old family.
