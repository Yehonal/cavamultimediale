Originating in the eleventh century, the Church of 
San Pietro is among the most important and best 
preserved of all the churches of Cava. The West 
Front contains a delightful entrance, flanked on 
either side by wall-paintings of two of the Apos-
tles, Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Inside the church 
can be found important works dating from the six-
teenth century, such as the sacristy in bas-relief 
marble depicting the four Evangelists by the side 
of the Holy Sacrament, and the high-relief depic-
tion of Santa Maria della Catena on the High Altar. 
The marvellous seventeenth century wooden cruci-
fix in the chapel to the right of the High Altar is the 
work of the sculptor Colombo. The High Altar was 
recently restored, and bears the coat-of-arms of the 
Galise family. The eighteenth century ceiling is 
striking. The sacristy contains a beautiful seven-
teenth century table, taken from the village chapel 
at Cafari, decorated with effigies of the Madonna 
del Rosario. Next to the church can be seen the 
Catalan doorway of thevilla once belonging to the 
Cafaro-Galise families. Many important docu-
ments referring to the history of Cava can be found 
in the Parish Records.
