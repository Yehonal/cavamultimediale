Tommaso Gaudiosi was a seventeenth century poet 
from Cava, who studied under the innovative Ital-
ian poet, Giambattista Marino. (Marino was fa-
mous for his composition style, as well as his use 
of words, meter, and themes). Gaudiosi left Cava 
as a young man, although he always maintained 
close links with the city of his birth, following the 
publication of a sonnet he wrote against certain 
important persons, "An Invective against a Hateful 
and Cursed City". He spent some time in Amalfi, 
later recording his memories of the place in the " 
Horrid Stanzas", and died in 1692. His work can be 
seen in Benedetto Croce's "An Anthology of Lyrics 
by the 'Marino' Poets". He produced a considerable 
volume of work, some of it quite outstanding. Of 
local topics and people, he wrote sonnets dedicated 
to the countryside, amongst them being "Mount 
San Adiutore"and "Mount Santissima Avvocata". 
He also wrote about the local institutions, such as 
the Abbey of Badia, along with the traditional local 
customs and past-times of the day, such as pigeon 
hunting, that took place every autumn in Cava. But 
he kept his best, or worst (depending on your point 
of view) for the wealthy inhabitants of Cava. In the 
poem "The Mother of Hate", he condemns the bad 
habits and attitudes of the young people of the city, 
condemning them for their failure to live up to the 
morals of their antecedents.
