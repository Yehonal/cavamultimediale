In 1648, at the age of eighteen, a bold young man 
from Cava, Nunzio Genovese, volunteered to lead 
an army against the French forces beseiging the 
castle overlooking Salerno. The story goes that 
Nunzio Genovese, along with his Master-at-Arms, 
Dionisio Guzman, 200 "trombonieri" from Cava 
and another 300 Spanish troops, devised an astute 
plan to break the siege. Equipping each of the sol-
diers with a flaming torch, he ordered that they 
move against the French by night, marching at a 
distance of some metres apart. Descending with his 
men from Casale di Croce above the castle of 
Salerno, the waiting French troops believed that an 
army of some 5000 men, not 500 men, was ap-
proaching (as the tradition of the time was that a 
torch would be carried by every tenth soldier, not 
every soldier). In panic, the French troops fled, 
leaving Nunzio Genovese to secure the release of 
the castle.
