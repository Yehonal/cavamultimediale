Captain Vincenzo Baldi will always be remem-
bered in Cava for his deeds at the Battle of St Lu-
cia Bridge, 27 April 1799. French soldiers, led by 
the famous General Watrim, were moving towards 
Cava, when the town council appointed Vincenzo 
Baldi to halt and push back the advance. The first 
meeting occurred at the Bridge of St. Lucia, where 
the angry local inhabitants confronted the French 
soldiers. A bloody and long-lasting fight ensued, 
with shots fired at the approaching soldiers by lo-
cals from the streets and houses of the village. 
Thanks to a cowardly villager, the French soldiers 
were able to fight their way through, setting Cava 
alight and putting the townspeople to sword. The 
villagers of St Lucia, along with Captain Baldi, 
were unable to assist the city as they were too busy 
protecting their village from marauding troops. In 
1806, this time under the command of General 
Massena, French soldiers again returned to Cava, 
once more to be confronted by Captain Baldi. This 
time the captain was less fortunate, being captured 
and imprisoned at Castelnuovo. On the return of 
the Bourbon kings to Naples, Baldi was released 
and showered with honours. To the citizens of 
Cava, their heroic Captain will always be remem-
bered with pride. Twice elected Mayor of the city, 
in 1802 and then again in 1817, his deeds have 
been immortalised in the painting by Clemente Ta-
furi, which is still on display in the Salone d'Hon-
ore at the Town Hall.
