In the midst of the Second World War, with all the 
hatred that it sowed, stood Mamma Lucia, a self-
less woman of love and humility. Armed only with 
a bucket and spade, she tirelessly searched the hills 
around Cava looking for bodies of the fallen, usu-
ally found buried in open graves. Assisted by Car-
mela Passaro and some local volunteers, Lucia 
Apicella would collect the "dog tags" along with 
the remains of these fallen soldiers, and then at-
tempt to contact their mothers. Nationality meant 
nothing to her, all that mattered was that the fallen 
should be remembered, and that their remains re-
turned to their families, where possible.. Those that 
remained unidentified were cremated, their ashes 
being kept in the Church of San Giacomo, in Cava. 
For this work, Lucia Apicella became known as 
"Mamma Lucia". For her work, Mamma Lucia was 
awarded with many honours. Amongst them, she 
received a private Audience from the Pope at the 
Vatican; a Commendation with Merit from the 
president of the Italian Republic; a Gold Medal 
from the Mayor of Rome; an Honorary Citizenship 
from the City of Salerno; and the Premio "Notte di 
Natale" (a sum of money) from the Motta Founda-
tion of Milan. She died in Cava on 28 August 1982 
and, prior to burial, her body was displayed at the 
Town Hall, so that well-wishers could pay their re-
spects.
