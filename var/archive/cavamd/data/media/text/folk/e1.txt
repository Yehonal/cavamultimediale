The Festival delle Torri (literally, “of the 
Towers) is held in Cava, every year in early 
August, at the Piazza Duomo, and lasts for 
three days. The Festival is international, in-
viting up to forty representatives from vari-
ous countries around the world to perform in 
front of four thousand spectators a night. 
The groups are selected each year by a 
committee chaired by C.I.O.F.F., an organi-
sation funded by UNESCO, from some of 
the best cultural and artistic organisations 
and groups in the world. One of the principle 
reasons for the Festival is the opportunity it 
gives, to citizens of Cava as well as to visi-
tors from around the world, to meet different 
people from a range of ethno-cultural back-
grounds. Originating in 1988, the Festival 
provides spectators with a kaleidoscope of 
cultural activities and short events, among 
the most popular being the opportunity to 
savour typical products, clothing, and food 
on offer to visitors and participants alike. 
The Festival has both national and interna-
tional recognition, being reported in the me-
dia in newspapers (La Repubblica, Il Sole 24 
Ore, etc) and on television (RAI, TMC, etc). 
On the last evening a panel of judges awards 
a “Peace Prize” to the group or organisation 
that has done most to promote the idea of 
international understanding and friendship 
throughout the preceding year.
