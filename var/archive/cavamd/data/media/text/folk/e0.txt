The International “Bandiera d’Argento” 
Prize is an international celebration of cul-
ture and costume, that arose from a proposal 
put forward by the Associazione Sbandiera-
tori of the City of  Cava. It is set in the 
splendid backdrop of the thousand year old 
Monastery of Badia, in the hills overlooking 
the City of Cava, and is noted for the interest 
it promotes, at a level of both education and 
entertainment, for cultural diversity, beauty, 
history among other things. Each year, the  
festival is dedicated to a single European 
country, with the costumes and customs of 
the chosen culture being at the forefront of 
the events. The costumes, though created for 
practical use, become almost animated… 
with a special life of their own. Devoid of 
the bodies of actors and singers, far from 
their native lands, the costumes and dress 
stand as witnesses to something greater than 
mere traditional clothing, they become 
works of art, entrancing the viewer with 
their own special magic.
