Work on the Duomo started in 1517, and it was 
completed fifty-four years later in 1571. The layout 
of the Duomo is that of a "Latin cross" with a rec-
tangular apse. In the transept, there is a tabernacle 
of four pillars surmounted by capitals. On either 
side of the nave are small, marble prayer-altars 
with eighteenth century canopies depicting relig-
ious motifs. The main door on the large west front 
flanked by two pilaster columns of Corinthian-
style capitals. Either side of the large door is a 
smaller door, with a curved window above the cor-
nices. The front is topped by a triangular timpano, 
with a clock at its' centre. On the outside, the 
Duomo still bears the scars of the 1980 earthquake, 
meanwhile restoration work is being carried out on 
the inside. Because of this work, the Duomo is 
presently closed to visitors.
