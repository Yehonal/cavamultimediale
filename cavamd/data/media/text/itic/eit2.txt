In one of the most important piazzas in Cava, once 
the site of an important local livestock market, can 
be seen an old Corinthian-style column, of lipolin 
marble. This column originated from a pre-
Christian temple found during construction of a 
church and monastery (dedicated to St Anthony of 
Padua) at the nearby Marina di Vietri. Mounted on 
the column is a sixteenth century cross along with 
an effigy of Christ. In the middle of the piazza is a 
marble fountain which was rebuilt from the origi-
nal, following its' destruction in 1694 by an earth-
quake.
