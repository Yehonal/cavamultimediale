Situated on the main street of Cava, the Church of 
St. Rocco and St Damiano probably incorporated 
the earlier little chapel of St Sebastian. Tradition 
states that the church was built at a time when the 
plague was ravaging the area. Of the original 
church, nothing remains, following destruction by 
bombs during the Second World War. Points of 
major artistic interest in the rebuilt church are the 
copy of "Christ of Cimabue", painted by the local 
artist Matteo Apicella, and some parts of the origi-
nal sixteenth century building that can be found in 
the Sacristy, at the side of the church.
