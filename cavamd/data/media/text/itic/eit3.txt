The story tells of a miraculous illuminated picture 
that was found in an elm tree in a small wood fre-
quented by scoundrels and murderers. The picture 
was taken down from the tree and carried in sol-
emn procession to the local church. Surprisingly, 
the following evening, the picture reappeared in 
the branches of the same tree in which it had been 
found, an obvious sign to all that the Madonna 
wished that a chapel should be built on that very 
site. The first stone of this chapel was laid in 1482. 
This chapel later became the Church of St Mary 
dell'Olmo. The picture of the Madonna can now be 
found in the branches of a bronze tree that over-
hangs an altar of multicoloured marble in the large 
presbytery of the church. Kneeling in front of the 
Madonna are the statues of four saints: St Adi-
utore, St Alfiero, St Francis da Paola and St 
Filippo Neri, all the work of the sculptor Francesco 
Ierace. The dome is painted with pictures repre-
senting the Glory of the Saints, and on the wooden 
coffer ceiling can be found pictures from the life of 
St Francis da Paola, painted by Ragolia in 1683. 
Other points of interest include the pulpit, the work 
of the young Alfonso Balzico, erected upon a 
sculpture of a lion and a bull, and the cantor, in 
wood inlay and gold, situated next to the entrance. 
The cloister is typical of the fifteenth century.
