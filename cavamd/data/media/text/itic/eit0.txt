In 1501, sixty Franciscan brothers led by Damiano 
De Licia took over the main church in the city, the 
Church of St Mary del Gesù, better known as the 
Church of St Francis. This was done so that the 
University in the city did not have to spend other 
money in building a new church. The University 
provided fixtures, fittings and other necessities as 
required. The earthquake of 1980 totally destroyed 
the old church, leaving just the front to preserve its 
original form. The beautiful sacristy, decorated 
with many frescoes attributed to Belisario Coren-
zio, has also been saved. In the sacristy can be seen 
a large handbasin for liturgical use, whose basin 
originates from the first or second century AD. 
Originally it was a marble sarcophagus, decorated 
in bas-relief depicting hunting scenes. The elegant 
main entrance, constructed in 1528, is the work of 
the master-builders Giovanni Marino Vitale and 
Marcantonio Ferrari. Its beaten-wooden door is 
fixed upon a black tufo stone, decorated with 
sculpturing and freezes in the style of Michelan-
gelo. To the right of the building is the imposing 
belltower, now only rising to the height of 35 me-
tres, following the collapse of the top two levels as 
a result of the 1694 earthquake. Among the many 
works of art to be found in the church is the picture 
of St Bartolomeo Scuoiata, attributed to Andrea 
Sabatini (better known as Andrea of Salerno) and 
The Last Supper, by Giuseppe Guerra, a disciple of 
Solimena. A statue depicting the Immaculate Con-
ception with St Francis and St Anthony is the work 
of Giuseppe Antonio Martino Carrozza of Naples.
