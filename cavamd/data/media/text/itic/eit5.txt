Built in 1750, the Church of Purgatory has a 
churchyard, at the distance prescribed on its con-
struction, from the overlooking monastery. Inside 
the church are kept the remains of the local saint, 
St. Feliciano. Architecturally, the church has un-
dergone many changes throughout its history. The 
points of greatest interest in the church are its 
Great Altar, constructed in 1700, with a sculpted 
marble balustrade, and a doorway, with a fresco 
mounted above it, depicting the Ascent of the Ma-
donna into Heaven.
