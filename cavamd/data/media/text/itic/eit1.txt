Attached to the Church of St Francis, at present 
under reconstruction, can be found a Franciscan 
monastery. It is the traditional seat of the city 
council, and the brothers have entertained the 
mayor and other elected members of the city at 
conventions held in the Refectory, since 1517. Of 
note, is the Oratorio Chapel of the Holy Concep-
tion, decorated in 1600. Construction of the build-
ing began in 1500. The square cloisters still retain 
their original design and architecture, consisting of 
six travertine pilasters each side, upon which are 
mounted arches. In the middle of the cloisters there 
once was a large octagonal cistern, used for col-
lecting rainwater, sculpted in 1595, and decorated 
in bas-relief marble. Unfortunately, this was stolen 
in January 1985.
