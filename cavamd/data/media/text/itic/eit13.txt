Listed in the Atlas of Historic Parks and Gardens, 
the Villa Communale (effectively, the public park 
in the centre of the City of Cava), was opened in 
1865, and is surrounded by a stone wall and 
wrought iron fencing. Access is via three large iron 
gates. The Villa is planted with rare trees, many of 
them being non-deciduous, and also contains a 
spinney that has been transferred from the grounds 
of the old Town Hall. In the centre of the Villa 
there is a large fountain, built in 1955, where pre-
viously stood a bandstand. Along a narrow lane 
nearby, there is gathered an interesting collection 
of archaeological artefacts. Amongst these arte-
facts is a white marble altar, found accidentally in 
a field in the village of San Giorgio, buried a metre 
down, upon which, inscribed in Latin, are details 
of a burial. Also in the Villa, can be found a large 
statue of a headless man, wearing an Etruscan-style 
cloak. Placed there in 1955, it had been previously 
used by local farmers as a boundary marker. It is 
very probable, that this is the same statue as that 
wrongly recorded by PietropaoloTeodoro, in 1580, 
as being a statue in white marble of a woman. 
Other items, of no lesser interest can also be found 
here.
