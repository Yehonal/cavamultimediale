On 15 September 1806, Joseph Buonaparte, King 
of Naples, decreed that the power of the City of 
Cava should be limited. The coastal towns of Vie-
tri sul Mare and Cetara were removed from its ju-
risdiction, and both were elevated to the level of 
"Comune", giving them limited control over their 
internal matters. Effectively, this was a fatal blow 
to Cava's pretensions to remain a rival power to the 
City of Salerno. In 1834, following administrative 
reorganisation under the restored Bourbon dynasty, 
the outlying villages of Casaburi, Sant'Anna, Du-
pino, Alessia, SS. Quaranta, Marini, and Arcara 
were removed from the control of the local seaside 
town of Vietri sul Mare and given back to Cava. 
Then, in 1860, General Garibaldi was welcomed as 
a guest of the City of Cava as he made his famous 
journey north via Naples to Rome, prior to the re-
constitution of the Italian State under King Vittorio 
Emanuele. Two World Wars brought nothing but 
disaster to Cava, with the city suffering destruction 
and looting following occupation by both German 
and Allied troops in 1943. Soon after the end of the 
Second World War, stories began to circulate 
about the compassionate activities of Mamma Lu-
cia (Lucia Apicella) and Carmela Passaro, who 
spent their war-time years searching and tending 
for injured and dying soldiers, heedless of their af-
filiations. In 1954, the village of Alesia suffered a 
massive mudslide, destroying the village, and kill-
ing or injuring many of the local inhabitants. In 
1980, Cava suffered from another natural disaster, 
one that over the centuries it has grown to accept. 
An earthquake flattened the village of Irpinia, seri-
ously damaging parts of the old City centre, such 
as the Duomo and the Franciscan Abbey, along 
with much of the old Borgo Scacciaventi. Recon-
struction work is still in progress today.
