After the bleak terrain of Monte Caruso, the visitor 
is immediately attracted by the woodlands that hug 
the Forcella of Cava. These woodlands cover a 
unique environment that is full of surprises. The 
scrubland that runs along the base consists of more 
than just evergreens, for it includes such plants as 
myrtle, arbutus, ilex, wild-olive, heather, juniper, 
coloured broom that create a haven of refuge and 
food for local fauna. The scrubland is surrounded 
by typical local moorland, with plants such as oat, 
wild fennel, wild carrot, white asphodel, pink and 
white cyst to be found. This mix of colour and 
smell attracts large numbers of butterflies – it’s not 
difficult to see Vanessa Butterfly grubs devouring 
the local nettle-patches - insects and insectivores. 
Wild orchids grow plentifully here, including the 
Monkey Orchid, the Spotted Orchid, and the Sol-
dier Orchid. One shouldn’t forget the cool, quiet 
woodlands either, where can be found trees such as 
beech, elm, ash, chestnut, bitter oak, and alder. 
One surprise is the presence of holly, a tree nor-
mally found in colder climates. The local oaks 
abound with galls produced by insect activity. In 
springtime, the grasslands of the Park are covered 
with aromatic plants such as thyme, lavender, rue, 
cress, etc, while the flowering of violet crocuses 
and the blue of the Apennine anemone lay the 
woodland floor with a natural carpet.
