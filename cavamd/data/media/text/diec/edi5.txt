The Visitors’ Centre is to be found at the entrance 
to the Park, where there is a small Natural History 
Museum and a display of local products. The Man-
agement offer courses in Environmental Education 
here to local schools and other organisations. Four 
different Walks can be chosen: the Nature Walk, 
educational and good for young people, where 
visitors can be entertained by poetry and stories on 
nature themes; the Hawk Walk, where it is possible 
to see various birds-of-prey; the Woodland Walk, 
an excellent summer walk as most of it is in shade; 
and the Two Bays Walk, where it is possible to 
view both the Bays of Naples and Salerno at the 
same time. Along these walks it is possible to 
study a variety of local species, such as bees in 
their hives, at specially created “educational ar-
eas”. There is a “Green Classroom” offering a 
novel educational environment in the woods, 
which has proved to be very popular with young 
people. There is also an “Orchid Garden” where 
visitors can see close at hand some of these won-
derful flowers in their natural environment. There 
are also in nest-building progress programmes to 
encourage birds to stay and breed.
