Since 1984, the City of Cava de' Tirreni has been 
twinned with the Westphalian city of Schwerte, in 
north-west Germany. Under this agreement, the 
two communities have agreed to promote links in 
such areas as culture, sport, commerce, social ac-
tivity, youth exchange, and handicrafts. Cava has 
also developed links with the US city of Pittsfield, 
in Massachusetts, and the Polish city of Gorzow 
Wielkopolski. Cava de' Tirreni (Kisinev), della 
Finlandia (Helsinki), della Russia (Mosca, 
Novgorod, Kirov) e della Germania (Memmingen, 
Wald) has also been keen to develop its Youth 
links with Spain (Valencia, Castellon de la Plana, 
Benicassim, Mislata, Manises), Moldavia (Kisi-
nev), Finland (Helsinki), Russia (Mosca, 
Novgorod, Kirov) and Germany (Memmingen, 
Wald). Also, since 1995, the City of Cava de' Tir-
reni organises, in collaboration with the Regione 
campania and the Italian Government, courses of 
Italian language and culture for up to twenty-five 
interested foreigners, who work in the area of 
Youth Development.
