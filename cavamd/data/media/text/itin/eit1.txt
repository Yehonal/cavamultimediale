Again to the southwest of Cava, between Castag-
neto (literally, "Little Chestnut Tree") and Corpo di 
Cava, in the area known by the Romans as Mitil-
iano, lies San Cesareo. Records of the place, with 
its small chapel, exist from 952 AD, and was an is-
sue of feudal wrangling between Prince Ruggiero 
and the Abbey of Badia as late as 1087 AD. Re-
mains of a Roman cemetery have been found in the 
grounds of the church, along with tombs bearing 
vestiges of lamps, common features on some Ro-
man tombs.
