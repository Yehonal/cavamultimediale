According to historians, the place got its name 
originally from the luxurious pastureland that was 
found there. Prior to being an area in its’ own right, 
it was part of the town of Corpo di Cava. The old 
village of Passiano still retains some of its large 
villas and original style, even though today build-
ings now stretch virtually uninterrupted from the 
City of Cava. As A. Polverino commented in 1716, 
in his book ‘A History of the City of Cava’, 
“Today, the place is recognised for its size and 
number of well-to-do families that live here.” In 
the past, the village built its wealth upon its wood-
land products and, above all, on its Siani mill, 
which employed many manual workers in the pro-
duction of the once-famous Cava cloth, and to and 
from which muleteers would carry raw material 
and finished cloth .
