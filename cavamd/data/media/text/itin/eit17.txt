Croce is the southernmost village of Cava, lying on 
the borders with Salerno, and having a superb view 
of the nearby Castle and across the Bay of Salerno 
to Cilento. The road up to the village from the 
crossroads between San Pietro and Rotolo is steep, 
winding through thick chestnut woods that cloak 
the side of the hills. The Church of Santa Croce, 
from which the village takes its' name, may have 
been started by local Armenian monks who took 
refuge in the area from persecution by Leone Is-
aurico.
