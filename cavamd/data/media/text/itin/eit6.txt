About four kilometres distance from the centre of 
Cava, it has been suggested that what is now Santa 
Lucia was either part of Passiano or San Adiutore, 
which stretches not only to the east of the Castle, 
but also as far as the village of Santa Lucia or 
Bagnara, close to Tirrento. The name of Bagnara 
(or Balnearia) comes from the once-famous ther-
mal springs that existed long ago. The name Citola, 
according to Roman commentators of the day 
came from the name of a now-lost spring, 
‘Acidula’. Indeed, in the eighteenth century, roman 
coins and burial objects were found in the area. 
Archaeological excavations have confirmed that 
the area was a possible graveyard, with a headless 
statue  dating from the First or Second century AD 
being found. At the time of the Parthenope Repub-
lic in 1799, during the time of the ‘Cava Counter-
Revolution’, as it was called by Raffaele Baldi, the 
villagers of Santa Lucia, led by a certain Captain 
Vincenzo Baldi, engaged and attempted to waylay 
approaching French troops. This “fiery and brave” 
group of armed villagers fought long and hard 
against regular soldiers, and the image is recorded 
in a painting by Clemente Tafuri, on display at the 
Town Hall. Old place-names, now disused, reflect 
activities that once occurred here. “Fiume” (liter-
ally, ‘river’) refers to an area below Monticello 
where the famous Cava cloth was washed prior to 
its export across Italy. At Curaturo (literally ‘cur-
ing-place’), there once stood the city’s works 
where women bleached and stretched there cloth in 
the sun. The traditional craft of rope-making still 
survives in a few places. The village of Santa Lu-
cia still prospers today.
