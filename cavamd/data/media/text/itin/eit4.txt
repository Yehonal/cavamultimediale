The Castle of St Adiutore, sitting atop a hill over-
looking the valley of Cava, is of uncertain date, 
with some saying that it originates from around 
787AD, whilst others say it is of a later date, pos-
sibly the tenth or eleventh century. What is certain 
is that it was given by Duke Ruggiero to Robert the 
Norman towards the end of the eleventh century, 
only to be sold on to the Abbey of the Holy Trinity 
at Badia in 1110 AD for the sum of 1000 ducats. 
Following its'purchase, it was jointly commanded 
by a senior monk and a knight, who oversaw both 
the permanent guard, resident in the castle, and the 
citizens who could be called up in time of need. 
The castle once more changed hands in 1291, 
when it was razed to the ground by Robert, Count 
Arras, viceroy to Charles II of Anjou. It was again 
rebuilt under King Ladislao, in1390, when the 
University of Cava exacted a tax on the city for its 
reconstruction, and was used from then on as a gar-
rison point whenever the city came under siege. 
From the seventeenth century the castle fell into 
disuse, culminating with its destruction in Septem-
ber 1943 during a bombing raid in the Second 
World War. In 1970, the Town council approved 
work for its restoration.
