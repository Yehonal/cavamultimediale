A fifteenth century document referred to this area 
as “Li Canali” (literally, “The Canals”). The vil-
lage of Pianesi got its name, some believe, from 
the fact that it was sited on a level area, or almost, 
with respect to the via Regia along which are 
found the shops and arcades. The road leading 
from Pianesi to the centre of Cava is named after 
the famous Cavese sculptor Alfonso Balzico 
(1825-1901) who owned a house here. As G. 
Trezza commented in 1913, “The sculptor was 
eleven years old when he found a small area of ex-
cellent sculpting clay along the path then known as 
“the Canals”, which he would visit every day so 
that he could take home some material with which 
he would model animal or human figures on the 
steps of San Francesco”.
