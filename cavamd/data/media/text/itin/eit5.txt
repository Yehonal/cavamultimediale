Pregiato is one of the oldest villages in the area, 
being now part of the district of San Adiutore, and 
stretching along the northwest slopes of Monte 
Castello as far as the via Regia. The names origin 
is uncertain, possibly originating from the Latin 
word ‘praesidiatus’, a strong-point situated on the 
via Maggiore, the road that passes behind the vil-
lage and on across the hills toward Salerno. Today, 
new housing replaces the once-extensive fields that 
separated Pregiato from the City of Cava, whilst 
here and there one can still spot images of the past 
on the road up to the village. Archaeological find-
ings confirm that the area was already inhabited in 
Roman times. According to the historian, O. Casa-
buri, writing in 1829, “It is very possible that Pre-
giato was a Lombard settlement, and that the 
Church of San Nicola, that still exists, goes back at 
least to 1168.
