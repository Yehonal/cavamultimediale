“Muralism” is the term given to wall-painting, 
much of its modern influence coming directly from 
the Mexican Revolution of 1910 and such artists as 
Orozco, Rivera, and Siqueiros. Wall-painting, and 
its modern day American offspring, “graffiti”, has 
a socio-political content as well as an aesthetic sig-
nificance. In large cities, such as New York and 
Los Angeles, graffiti is viewed as the art of a mar-
ginalised society, an art form that occasionally 
creeps into the culturally significant galleries and 
shows of the rich. The art of the street was, ac-
cording to Goldstein (writing in the New York 
Magazine in 1972), a new art form that gained 
public acceptability with the founding of CoLab in 
1980 and the opening of the Mud Club in 1981, 
where artists such as Rammelzee, Basquiat, and 
Haring were able to put on public exhibitions of 
their works. In 1982, Kassel’s “Document 7” pre-
sented works which encouraged European artists to
experiment with similar art forms.
In the 1970’s, Milan became the Italian centre of 
“Muralism”, an art phenomenon that has since 
spread south to cities such as Cava de' Tirreni. Mu-
ralist artists in Cava have moved beyond the ag-
gressive, often nihilist messages of early graffiti 
artists, often employing designs of strikingly col-
ourful, three-dimensional, harmonious designs. 
Some of the best examples on view of works by 
“street artists” in Cava are to be found outside the 
city’s Social Centre, where large murals have been 
created with the support of the Town Hall.
