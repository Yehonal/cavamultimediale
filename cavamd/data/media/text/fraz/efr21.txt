According to the seventeenth century writer Car-
raturo, there were originally five churches in Bag-
naro. One was the Church of San Arcangelo sul 
Monticello, already destroyed when he wrote.  
Others were the Churches of San Gregorio, San 
Giovanni, and San Agnese of which, by his time, 
little remained. Finally there was the Church of 
Santa Lucia, founded in 1047, though on a site dif-
ferent from that of the church that replaced it. To-
day, the "new" parish Church of Santa Lucia is still 
an impressive structure, built in 1600, and recently 
restored following the earthquake of 1980. The 
west front, split into two parts, is richly decorated, 
whilst internally the Church is constructed around 
three large naves. Of the most important works of 
art to be found, there is a wonderful statue of Santa 
Lucia in multicoloured wood, a depiction of the 
life of Santa Lucia by the artist Ragolia, painted 
1677, as well as a painting of the Madonna del Ro-
sario overhanging the High Altar. This altar, con-
structed in the seventeenth century of marble, was 
originally to be found in the Church of San Gio-
vanni al Borgo (today, the ex-praetura), but was 
removed to its present location following the sup-
pression of religious orders in 1866.
