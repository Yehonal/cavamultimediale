The village of Annunziata is one of the oldest vil-
lages in the area, situated as it is on the south-east 
slope of Mount Castello, where can be found the 
local Parish Church dedicated to the Vergine An-
nunziata. According to the date carved on a stone 
of the Church, it was built in 1506, and replaced 
the older Church of Santa Maria a Toro as the par-
ish seat. It underwent major reconstruction in the 
eighteenth century, and still retains much of its 
most interesting aspects, despite depredation by 
thieves over the years. The front of the Church re-
tains its decorative stone main doorway, with relief 
floral motifs and carvings of the Hapsburg Charles 
V of Spain and other dignitaries of the time. Con-
structed of the local dark grey volcanic tufo, it 
stands out in sharp contrast to the whiteness of the 
walls around. There is also a fresco depicting the 
Annunciation to be found in one of the lunettes, 
unfortunately, however, it has suffered from the 
ravages of time. Inside, on the High Altar, there is 
a sixteenth century painting of the Annunciation by 
Marco Cardisco that has been recently restored. 
Another picture from the same era, this time of the 
Immacolata, can also be found in the north tran-
sept. To the right, on the first altar, there is a won-
derful terracotta statue of the Madonna delle Gra-
zie, dating back to the sixteenth century. The statue 
is lucky to be still existent as, during the Second 
World War, when Allied soldiers were sweeping 
west and north from the Bay of Salerno, a shell 
landed at the foot of the statue but failed to ex-
plode. During the same action, in September 1943, 
a nearby Convent, once for a Closed Order of 
nuns, was also hit.
