Overlooking the village of Santa Lucia to the north 
is the bleak Monte Caruso, rising to a height of 763 
metres. In the past, it was here that the old main 
road ran, from Naples to Salerno, before climbing 
towards the east and entering the Pass of Salerno. 
(Traditionally, this road was much more popular 
with weary travellers than the lower via Regia that 
followed the valley floor for, although a more dif-
ficult passage, it was safer). A crack in the rock 
that runs along the side of the old road, signposted 
by the Club Alpino Italiano with the number "18", 
shows where the old tollgate once stood. Today, 
the asphalt road passes Scarico (once an old timber 
yard for the area) and the small nature reserve of 
"Diecimare" on its way to the villages of San Fe-
lice and Santa Anna.
