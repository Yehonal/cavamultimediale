The Chapel of Santa Maria a Toro dates back to 
the end of the first millennium, and is the oldest 
parish church in San Adiutore, but fell into disre-
pair and was replaced as the principle place of 
worship in the area following construction of a 
new church. The Church of Santa Maria "ad To-
rum" (literally, "grassy hillock") was mentioned in 
documents dated 1169, when under the control of 
Abbot Beato Marino, according to the historian, 
Polverino. Inside can be found a marvellous door-
way, made from sculpted stone, which dates from 
around 1500. From the sacristy one can pass by the 
"puliere", an eighteenth century tower. Once the 
local headquarters of the "Spirito Santo" Brother-
hood, the Church can be seen in a recent painting 
of The Last Supper and The Pentecost. A local 
group, consisting of the congregation and other 
volunteers, has restored the medieval Church to its' 
original design.
