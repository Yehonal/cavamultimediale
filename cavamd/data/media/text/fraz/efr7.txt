Once the hunters of pigeons would hang their nets 
from two towers in this beautiful valley. One tower 
is clearly visible from the ‘alpine’ chalet built by 
Marquis Talamo at the end of the nineteenth cen-
tury, the other tower, known as the “Foglia” is to 
be seen lower down on the slopes of Monte Cas-
tello. The area, which delighted many nineteenth 
century painters, offers wonderful views over the 
Plain of Nocera and on to Vesuvius. In the 1930s, 
many visitors would come to watch the crossbow 
competitions held here, but the sport is no longer 
practised here. Below, where the road rises toward 
the Castle, Mamma Lucia uncovered the bodies of 
twelve German soldiers during the Second World 
War. Today, the Pineta suffers from frequent traf-
fic and needs continuous maintenance. A small 
road leading from the area takes you to the little 
Church of Santa Maria a Toro.
