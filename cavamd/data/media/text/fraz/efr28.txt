Originally known as the Church of Santa Maria 
delle Grazie and San Lorenzo", it was built in 1490 
by Liberato d'Anna for the Cardinal Oliviero Cara-
fa, following permission given by his brother, 
Alessandro Carafa, then the Archbishop of Naples 
and Vicar of the City of Cava. On its consecration, 
reports the Neapolitan lawyer Luise Granato, on 22 
December of the same year, Liberato also reque-
sted that mass be said twice weekly for the next 
fifteen years. From its inception, the Church was 
granted to the Parish of San Pietro a Mannarino, 
and copies of a plea still remain from when a cer-
tain Vicar Capitolare issued a decree for assistance. 
The Church was rectangular in shape, with an 
exquisite marble Baroque altar. On either side of 
the altar there were coats-of-arms, one of San Pie-
tro, the other of San Lorenzo, whilst on the altar 
there stood a beautiful "cona", half corinthian and 
half baroque, possibly of the sixteenth century. The 
altar was decorated on three sides, in the middle 
was a carving of the Madonna delle Grazie, whilst 
on the other sides were carvings of San Giovanni 
Batista and San Lorenzo. Following the ravages of 
time, along with the infliction of serious damage 
during the Second World War, the old Church was 
demolished and replaced by a new one, in Modern 
Roman style. Of the old church, only the altar re-
mains. Thanks to the efforts of the d'Amico brot-
hers, amongst others, the first stone of the new 
Church was laid on 15 March 1967, with the 
Church opening its doors to a new congregation 
two years later. Today, the parish counts about 
6000 souls in all.
