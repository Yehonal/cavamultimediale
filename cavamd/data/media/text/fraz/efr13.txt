The pass, opening in a beautiful part of Mount San 
Liberatore, lies close by the village of Alessia, and 
provides a striking contrast between the blue of the 
Tyrrhenian Sea and the green of the valley of 
Cava. According to documents dated 1062, a cer-
tain Prince Gisulfo II secured his control of the 
valley, for he delighted in hunting pigeons that 
were found in the local woods. Of the church of 
San Vito, also mentioned in these documents, 
nothing remains. Close by could be found 
"Manfred's Tree", overlooking an old, abandoned 
hunting-lodge. This tree, rising to a height of 
twenty-four metres, believed to be nearly a thou-
sand years old, was last documented in a local 
study of the area done at the turn of the century.
