Due to the lack of space that existed between "Ar-
siccia's Cave" and the little stream (known as the 
"Selano"), the early builders were unable to build a 
large cloister, suitable to the magnificence of the 
monastery. Instead, between the eleventh and thir-
teenth centuries, a small cloister arose, possibly 
one of the most charming aspects of the religious 
centre at Badia. Next to the cloisters can be found 
the large, eighteenth century, Chapter room, with 
its valuable Third century Roman tombs. The re-
mains of a Roman wall at the deepest part of "Ar-
siccia's Cave" bear proof to the existence of human 
habitation here prior to San Alferio's time.
