San Benedetto College was started in 1867, sited in 
an airy and spacious part of the Monastery, to-
wards the front of the large complex. The private 
school, consisting of both Day (male and female) 
and Boarding (male only) students, encompasses a 
Middle School, along with a Junior and Senior 
High School. Education includes a choice of Clas-
sical or Science-based curricula. Both are recog-
nised by the State, the classical curriculum in 1894, 
and the scientific curriculum is post-war in origin. 
Many luminaries of present and past Italian society 
number among its alumni, attesting to its pre-
eminent position in pre-University level education.
