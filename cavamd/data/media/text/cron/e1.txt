Alferio Pappacarbone, a nobleman from Salerno, took some monks with him up 
into the hills around Cava. Initially, they chose the summit of Monte San Elia as a 
place to reside, but then decided on the large Cave of Arsiccia – now known as the 
Cave of Metellia - as their permanent home. There, a year later, in 1012, they 
started to build a church, that would become the centre of the story and life of the 
Benedictine Order in Cava, of which Alferio became its first Abbot.
