The old laws of mortmain, and other traditional encumbrances on property are re-
moved under legislation from the new Italian Government, the most sweeping pos-
sibly being a major attack on the role and property of the Catholic Church. As part 
of this action, the Monastery and Church of Santissima Trinità is taken from the 
Benedictines and given to the new Italian Kingdom. The Abbot, Don Michele 
Morcaldi, and Monks are decreed custodians of the Monastery, and the building is 
declared a National Monument.
