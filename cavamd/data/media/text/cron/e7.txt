On 7 August 1394, Pope Boniface IX raises Cava to city status, and declares that 
the Abbot of Badia should be elevated to the status of Bishop. The Church of San-
tissima Trinità is declared a Cathedral, its Chapter consisting of the monks of Ba-
dia, and its leader elevated to the status of Prior. Part of this story is reported in 
Guillaime’s, “History of the Abbey of Cava”, and he starts by declaring “The land 
of Cava, thanks to Heaven’s benediction, many of its’ citizens, along with other di-
vine favours, as history has shown, is the most prosperous of the many towns in the 
area. It includes large tracts held under the Benedictine Monastery of Santissima 
Trinità of Cava. The Monastery brooks no intermediary, being directly and solely 
responsible to Rome…. Thus, should the land of Cava be elevated to the status of 
City, and the Church of the Monastery to the status of Cathedral, this action would 
be justly seen as dignified, laudable, extremely useful and pleasing to the citizens 
and monks of Cava…Therefore we elevate the land of Cava to that of a City, and 
we decorate it with the title and insignia of a city and, as a record of what we have 
done, declare that it will always be called the City of Cava….
