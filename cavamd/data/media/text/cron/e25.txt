On his triumphal march toward Naples, capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, 
Giuseppe Garibaldi passed through the City of Cava, where he stopped for a short 
while at the house of Atenolfi. Before Garibaldi entered the city, it was festooned 
with flowers along the ‘portici’ and tricolours, made by a certain Michelina Adi-
nolfi, were distributed by his supporters amongst the citizens. On parting for 
Naples, from the railway station, Garibaldi received rapturous acclaim by the men 
and women of Cava alike, being wished according to an onlooker of the time “Do 
what you have to do!”
