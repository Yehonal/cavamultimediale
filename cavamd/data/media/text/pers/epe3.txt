Giovanni Canale was another sixteenth-century 
Cava poet attracted by the methodology and style 
of the 'Marinist' poets. He was born in Pianesi, 
Cava, where his house can still be seen today, then 
moved to work as an officer for the Bourbon Royal 
Customs in Naples, where he soon stood out as a 
man of principle and warmth. He published his po-
ems in Venice in 1667, reprinted in Naples in 
1694. He usually wrote on moral, praiseworthy, or 
sacred themes, that exemplified the beauty and 
harmony reflected by 'Marinist' poetry. Much of 
his work concentrated on the people and places of 
Cava, with perhaps one of his best poems being 
"Time Reborn", written on the Consecration of the 
Cathedral of Cava, 4 May 1642. Much of his work 
can be seen in Benedetto Croce's "An Anthology 
of Lyrics by the 'Marino' Poets".
