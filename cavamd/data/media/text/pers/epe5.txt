Sabato Castaldi Martelli, was born in Cava on 19 
August 1896. He started his military career in 
1916, enrolling in 1917 in the Italian Air Force. He 
transferred to the Austrian front, after graduating 
as a pilot, where he gained rapid distinction as a 
formidable and courageous dog-fighter, winning a 
Silver Medal, along with a Bronze and two men-
tions in despatches. In 1919, he volunteered for 
service in Libya, where he earned another Military 
Cross, along with two more mentions in des-
patches. In May 1927, he was appointed com-
mander of the Seventh Fighter Group, being 
awarded another Bronze medal later that year. The 
following year, 19828, he was promoted to lieu-
tenant colonel. Two years later, in 1930, he rose to 
the rank of colonel, the first in Italian aeronautical 
history, when he was appointed commander of the 
Twentieth Group. Following the occupation of It-
aly by the Germans in 1943 he, as Administrative 
and Technical Director for Ammunitions, along 
with General Lordi, started working secretly for 
the Resistance. Denounced by collaborators, Mar-
telli and Lordi were imprisoned by the German SS 
at Via Tasso. On his cell wall, Martelli wrote 
"When the body is no longer, your spirit will still 
live in the memories of those left behind. Always 
try to be an example to others." He was executed at 
Fosse Ardeatine on 24 March 1944, shouting 
"Viva l'Italia".
