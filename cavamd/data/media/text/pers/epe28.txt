Born in Cava in 1831, he was ordained in 1854, 
and moved to Naples so that he could study for his 
degree and dedicate himself to the analysis of old 
documents. He was a frequent visitor to the Li-
brary at Badia, where he prepared the defence of 
four abbots against the Curia at the Vatican. He 
was also a frequent visitor, along with his friend, 
Prince Filangieri, to the Archives of the City of 
Salerno, where they worked to compile two enor-
mous Indexes on large and small works of art. He 
reorganised the city archives of Potenza and Cava, 
the archives of the Congrega of Cava (675 volumes 
in all) as well as assisting on the State Archives at 
Naples with Abbot Guariglia. He published many 
works, one of which on Gianbattista Castaldo, the 
Field-Marshall under Charles V of Spain. Among 
other works of interest are "The C in Cava hapel of 
St Mary of Stella nel Cilento", in which he sup-
ported claims by Badia for ownership of the fa-
mous sanctuary, and "Marcina Salerno".
