Giulio Genoino was a jurist and politician, born in 
Cetara, a coastal village of Cava, in 1567. He is 
best remembered as one of the ringleaders of the 
Masaniello revolt, which aimed at levelling social 
distinctions between rich and poor, aristocrat and 
peasant. In 1620, he appealed to the Hapsburg, 
Filipo III, but was exiled to Spain for his pains. On 
his return to Naples, he returned to his political ac-
tivities, this time on the issue of taxation. He was 
imprisoned a year later, in the Neapolitan prison of 
Castelnuovo, for writing an invective against the 
tax on flour. On the death of Masaniello, the fish-
monger and revolutionary, Genoino agreed a truce 
with the Spanish Viceroy, and left Naples in 1647. 
He died while on the way to Port Mahon, 1648.
