Born in Cava in 1683, his family moved to Naples 
when he was very young. He studied law, but his 
passion was writing poetry, writing under the 
pseudonym of Abuzio Arsura,. He preferred to 
write in the vernacular as, to him, it was closer to 
the real emotions of the people; it was lighter, 
fuller and more melodic than the Court language of 
the day. One of his best poems, is "Mortella d'Or-
zolone", a paean to the simple life, though the one 
that brought him fame is "Le Binte Rotole de lo 
Valanzone". This is a poem that talks about life at 
"Portico della Stadera", a classical School of Phi-
losophy, where the teachers sought to harmonise 
Christian and Stoic philosophies. He is also famous 
for his translation of "Batracomiomachia", into the 
Neapolitan dialect.
