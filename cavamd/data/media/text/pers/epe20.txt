Born in Cava 19 August 1891, Giovanni Bassi was 
a sub-lieutenant in the 219th Infantry when the First 
World War started. During the War he displayed 
his altruism, bravery, and characteristic concern for 
his fellow men. Injured for the first time at Gorizia, 
on the Austrian front, he was later awarded the Sil-
ver Medal for Valour following his brave action on 
July 1-2, 1916. Injured for the second time at 
Pasubio, near Adige, he continued to fight on, 
hiding the fact that he had been seriously wounded 
in action. He was also engaged at Valle Posina, 
and at the Borcola Pass. He was killed on 20 
August 1916, whilst leading his men across Mount 
Maio in the Trentino Alps. Remembered for the 
encouragement  he always gave his troops: "Al-
ways onwards, Sons of Italy!", he was further 
decorated with the Silver Medal, the Cross of 
Merit, and other distinctions.
