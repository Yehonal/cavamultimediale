Giuseppe Trezza was born in Passiano, Cava, in 
1876, and died in 1954. He was educated first at 
the town's Ginnasio and then at the Liceo at Badia, 
he graduated from the University of Naples in 
1989. Educated in both the fields of Arts and Sci-
ences, he was often called upon to teach in such 
diverse areas as biology, latin, mathematiccs, phi-
losophy, and geography. In 1927, he was instructed 
by the Dante Alighieri Society, of which he was a 
member, to tour the length and breadth of Brazil, 
giving lectures on Italy, its history and its culture. 
He wrote numerous pamphlets on religious mat-
ters; a brief history of the Basilica of the Madonna 
dell'Olmo and the Sanctuario del Rovo; a mono-
graph on the local sculptor Alfonso Balzico; criti-
cisms on the works of Manzoni, Pascoli, and 
Dante; and translated the Angelus del Coppè. A 
school in Cava was named after him in his honour.
