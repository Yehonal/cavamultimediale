Onofrio De Giordano was a distinguished six-
teenth-century architect and painter from Cava, 
who worked both in Cava and Naples. Indeed, 
there is a nineteenth-century short story about Ma-
succio Salernitano, a contemporary of Onofrio de 
Giordano, , where he recounts and assesses the 
work of this Cavese architect and painter. It is for 
work outside of Italy for which the architect is best 
known. In the first volume of the work "Dalmatia 
in Italian Art", Alessandro Dudan outlines the im-
portant role played by Onofrio de Giordano in the 
art and architecture of the region, as well as point-
ing out the merits of his best works. Much of this 
was done for the beautiful, old City of Dubrovnik, 
where one can still admire two civic fountains that 
he designed: the larger one, known as the "Onofrio 
Fountain", and the smaller, known as the "Cava 
Fountain". Other notable works of his to be found 
in Dubrovnik include the elegant, venetian-style 
"Rectors' Palace" and the florid, gothic "Palace of 
Zecca", a veritable jewel.
