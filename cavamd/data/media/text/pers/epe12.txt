Orsola Benincasa was born to work in the service 
of God. From an early age she would go into ec-
stasy at the sound of "Amor Divino" or on the ap-
proach of the Eucharist. Wishing to give herself to 
God, she asked to be allowed to enter the Convent 
of Santa Maria di Gerusalemme, but was refused 
on grounds of her age. At Holy Communion she 
would have spiritual experiences, her body stiff-
ening, her body temperature rising such that she 
would need to be doused with ice-cold water. She 
would laugh, claim to hear singing, and have dia-
logues with "ectoplasms", she spoke constantly of 
the cross and conversion of disbelievers. She asked 
to visit the Pope, Gregorio XIII, to urge him on in 
his work of redemption in the world, but on meet-
ing him fell into a trance three times. The Pope be-
lieved that she was possessed, and ordered that she 
be taken in front of a committee presided over by 
Filippo Neri. She was put under constant surveil-
lance, ordered to perform menial tasks, was con-
stantly insulted, and was kept at a distance from 
the Eucharist. At Napoli, she was threatened with 
burning at the stake, but was rescued by Filippo 
Neri and sent home. Returning to her retreat at 
Sant'Elmo, under strict supervision, she founded 
the "Congregazione dell'Immacolata Concezione", 
dedicated to the education of young girls. She died 
in 1618.
