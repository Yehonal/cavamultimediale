The Rope-making industry in the valley of Cava is 
closely tied to the local agricultural, boat-building 
and maintenance, and fishing industries. With their 
traditional links to the sea, it is not surprising that 
such an industry has grown up here, over the cen-
turies, especially in the small coastal towns of 
Cetara and Raito. It is suggested by some, that the 
industry first started at Santa Lucia, in the fifteenth 
century, when a settler from Prato brought with 
him some hemp to make rope. Soon production in 
the area grew, with local families mechanising 
their production by placing two wooden, cross-
shaped devices, three metres apart ("filaturi") at 
either end of a strip of land, fifteen metres long. 
Production was comparatively simple with, at one 
end, on one of the filaturi, would be placed a turn-
ing device for winding the hemp into rope, whilst 
at the other end would be tied together the strands 
of hemp. A block of wood, bored with small holes, 
a "pigna", would be used to adjust and maintain 
constant torsion and diameter. This "pigna" would 
then be drawn slowly along the hemp strands to-
wards the end with the winding mechanism. Until 
the beginning of the 1960s, when nylon ropes be-
gan to rapidly replace traditional hemp ones, the 
specialist rope-makers of Santa Lucia were famous 
across Italy and beyond. Today, industrial proc-
esses have virtually killed off the traditional meth-
ods. One of these modern producers is Lamberti, 
where up to 1000 kilograms of synthetic fibre rope 
is produced daily.
