The front of the building next to the small Piazza 
del Purgatorio has kept the traditional neo-classical 
form of its sixteenth century origins. The front is 
made up of two separate parts. The first consists of 
a square, stone pedestal, from which rise two pil-
lars supporting three arches, decorated with alter-
nating garlands and cherubim on the scrolled Ionic 
capital. The second, divided by horizontal lines, 
consists of three apertures: two lateral windows 
with a circular drum, and a central balcony with a 
triangular drum. The Baroque entrance is con-
structed of local pipernoid tufo stone.
