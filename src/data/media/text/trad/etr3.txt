The game of the pigeons, was a pigeon-hunt with a 
difference, that was found in only one other place, 
that of Adocor, in Gascony, on the French side of 
the Pyrenees. In Cava, as in Spain, the methods of 
hunting are almost identical, based on the natural 
instincts of the birds to fly the shortest route across 
valleys on their emigrations south during the 
months of October and November each year. The 
narrow passes through the hills, rich with oaks and 
other trees, become virtual ‘flight paths’ for the pi-
geons, and are used by the hunters who throw large 
nets into the flight path of their oncoming prey. 
The “Game” as it was called by its protagonists 
(partly because it used the same rules of ‘play’ – 
method of hunting, the same hunting areas, the 
towers and other apparatus used by the hunters) is 
of ancient origin, being held in high esteem by 
Lombard nobles, who reserved distinct hunting 
grounds for its practise. It is quite possible that the 
origins of the “Game” here in Cava is thanks to 
those Lombard nobles. For over thirty years there 
has been no hunting of pigeons in Cava, partly be-
cause the pigeons no longer take the inland Cava 
route on their journey south, preferring the calmer 
and safer passage along the coast.
