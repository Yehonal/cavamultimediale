Matteo Apicella was born in Pregiato, on the out-
skirts of Cava, on 16 February 1910, and by the 
age of ten was already displaying the talent that 
would make him one of Cava's finest painters and 
sculptors of the twentieth century. He was encour-
aged by the local artist, Clemente Tafuri, who per-
suaded Apicella to join him at the First National 
Picture Exhibition. From 1949, Matteo Apicella 
participated in numerous large national art shows, 
as well as holding hundreds of his own and run-
ning an Art Gallery at Ravello. Perhaps the most 
outstanding of his works is the "Crucifixion of Ci-
mabue", painted for the Church of San Rocco, in 
Cava. He died in Cava on 22 February 1996.
