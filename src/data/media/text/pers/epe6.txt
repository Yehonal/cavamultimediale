Born on 24 September 1880, in the picturesque 
village of Pregiato, he was educated at the Liceo 
"Tasso" in Salerno, and then went on to graduate in 
Literature at the University of Naples, under the 
celebrated Professor Cocchia. He worked, initially, 
as a teacher of Literature at Rossani, in Calabria, 
and then in Salerno. In 1910, following his success 
in State competitions in Classical Literature, he 
went on to teach in Cosenza, Benevento, Caserta, 
and the Military College of Naples. In 1928, he 
was invited to teach Literature at the University of 
Pavia, but was called back to his native southern 
Italy two years later to take over the Chair of his 
old Professor, Cocchia, at the University of Naples. 
He was interested in the Humanities, but was also 
interested in religious education, with much of his 
work being written in Latin. He contributed to the 
Treccani Encyclopaedia, as well as writing articles 
in Latin for many magazines and periodicals. His 
bronze bust can be seen at the Town Hall in Cava: 
Another bust, this time in marble, along with  a 
commemorative stone, can be found at a small 
chapel of the Church of Pregiato. The local Gram-
mar School is named in his honour.
