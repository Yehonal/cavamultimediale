Born in Cava in 1824, he was a genial and hard-
working neo-Classical painter. He painted mainly 
religious and historical themes, recognisable for 
their elegance of form, and vivid, fresh colours. 
Many of his works can still be admired at the art 
gallery in the Abbey of Badia, and in houses and 
churches across southern Italy. He painted the 
"Dance of the Hours" at the Casino in Salerno, 
whilst in Cava he painted the old chapel of the 
Sisters of St. John, the ceiling and arches of the 
Church of St Francis, and the rose-window in the 
Basilica of the Madonna dell'Olmo.
