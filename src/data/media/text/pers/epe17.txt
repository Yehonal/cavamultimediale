At the base of a monument, close to the entrance of 
the Church of St Francis, in Cava, written in ele-
gant latin, is a brief history of this military com-
mander. Born in Cava, in the sixteenth century, of 
noble parentage, he was a brave and proud soldier. 
Rising to the rank of Lieutenant-General, in the  
army of Philip IV, he was renowned for the train-
ing and discipline he instilled into  his soldiers. He 
distinguished himself on campaigns in Liguria, 
Belgium, and Cisalpine Gaul, and was rewarded by 
becoming Governor for Asti, Gallipoli di Scilla, 
and Taranto. He is best remembered for his gallant 
defence of Taranto, when forcing the invading 
army of Thomas of Savoy to flee.
