Michele Morcaldi was born in Cava in 1818 and, 
whilst still very young, was put into the care of the 
Bendictine monks of The Holy Trinity at Badia. 
He became a follower of St Benedict, taught phi-
losophy, but spent much of his time studying his-
tory and diplomacy. In this latter pursuit, he was 
undoubtedly assisted by the many visitors who 
came to Badia to study at the Library. All spoke 
well of him and his archival skills.His life's major 
work was organising the "Codex Diplomaticus 
Cavensis". He also wrote "The Bill of Urban II and 
its Critics", a book  commended for its style and 
analysis. Thanks to his skill and good works, he 
was appointed Abbot and Ordinario of the Diocese 
of Badia of the Holy Trinity of Cava. Following 
his ordination, he was invited to join the Organisa-
tion of the Four Holy Founding Fathers by Abbot 
Morcaldi.
