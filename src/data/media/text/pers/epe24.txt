Born in Cava in 1856, he was a marvellous painter 
of the life of his time. Studying under Smargiassi, 
then Mancinelli and Morelli, he developed his 
skills as an artist, specialising in realistic and col-
ourful scenes from the lives of the people around 
him. Among his best works are  "The Government 
Clerk", "On Vesuvius", "St Lucia", "Young Girl 
Selling Fish", "The Toast", " The Marrow-Seller", 
"Mother", and "Luigi Settembre at the Sentencing 
of St Stephen" (this work, one of the outstanding 
examples of nineteenth century Neapolitan paint-
ings, is on show at the Galleria d'Arte Moderna in 
Rome). He died in 1912, scarcely recognised, poor 
and forgotten. He made little money from his work 
whilst alive, only after his death did his pictures 
begin to realise their true worth, both from the 
point of view as works of art and objects of value.
