There wasn't a war fought in Italy, Germany, 
Flanders or Hungary, from 1520 until after the 
death of Charles V, in which this bravest of sol-
diers was not involved. He was trained at the mili-
tary school of "Maestro Il Pescara" at Avalos. At 
the Battle of Pavia, in 1535, he seriously wounded 
Lord La Palisse (who was later brutally killed by a 
Spanish captain) and took prisoner Francis I. After 
conducting a Hungarian campaign, he was 
awarded a gold medal, upon the front of which was 
inscribed, along with his head, the words " < Ioan. 
Bapt. Castaldus dux belli maxim. >"; on the re-
verse, the medal bore his figure, raising a female 
warrior, with the inscription "<Subactae  Daciae 
restitutore optimo >". Following a further cam-
paign, this time in Transylvania, he was decorated 
with yet another gold medal, on the front of which 
it bore his portrait and on the reverse a young 
woman lying in a field, which represented Tran-
sylvania. He wrote on military affairs, dictated to 
his secreatary, Ascanio Centorio; and delighted in 
poetry, being a good friend of the Tuscan poet, 
Areto. He was richly rewarded for his bravery and 
services to the Hapsburgs (twice appointed co-
manding officer in Hungary by Charles V's 
brother, Fredinand, King of Rome) and, in 1556, 
was knighted Marquis of Cassano and Governor of 
Milan.
