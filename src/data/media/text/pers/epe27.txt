Born in Cava in 1889, he was still a student at uni-
versity when he attracted the attention of Torraca, 
his professor, and the great Benedetto Croce, who 
together entrusted him with editing the works of 
Bertole for La Terza's "Italian Writers". In 1912, 
under the pseudonym of Felice Campania, he pub-
lished a small volume of lyrics entitled "Pervirgil-
ium". Following continued study, he produced 
many works, some of his best being "A Critical 
Study of Farce 'Cavaiole'", "the Art and Erudition 
of Carducci", "the Character of Masaniello", 
"Captain Vincenzo Baldi and the Counter-
revolution in Cava". He also wrote many articles 
which were published in newspapers and maga-
zines around Italy. He was elected Mayor in 1922, 
and was awarded the honour of Knight of the 
"Cappa e Spada" by the Vatican. He died on 20 
September 1943, during an Allied bombing mis-
sion. His bronze bust can be seen at the Town Hall.
