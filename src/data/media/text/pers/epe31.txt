These two brothers, mercenaries from St Arcan-
gelo in the district of Pasculano, Cava, are remem-
bered for their deeds against the French troops 
from Anjou. Giosuè and Marino Longo led an 
army of about eight hundred armed citizens from 
Cava, on the long night of 7 July 1460 towards 
Naples, breaking through the French lines on the 
way by the banks of the River Sarno. This action 
secured the Aragon dynasty, under king Ferrante, 
in southern Italy.
