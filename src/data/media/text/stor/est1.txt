The origin and meaning of the name "Cava" re-
mains to this day an object of conjecture. Some, 
like the writer Marino Freccia in 1579, suggest that 
it derives from the "cava" (meaning "mine, or 
quarry") of the Arsiccia caves of Monte Finestra 
(literally, "Window"), the mountain that overlooks 
the present-day city, which first attracted the 
Benedictine monks to the area over a thousand 
years ago. Others, like the writer Agnello Polver-
ino in 1716, suggest that the name merely reflects 
the morpho-geographic effect of the valley of 
Cava, where a "circle of mountains creates a large, 
but delightful hollow". The City of Cava de' Tir-
reni probably grew out of the destruction of the an-
cient Samnite settlement of Marcina. As the writer 
Strabone states, "Marcina, founded by the Tirreni 
tribe and inhabited by Samnites, lies between Si-
renusse and Posidonia. From here, on past Nocera 
to Pompeii extends an isthmus of land no more 
than about 120 stadii (approximately 40 kilome-
tres). The confines of Marcina stretch along the 
coast from Cetara to the port of Vietri sul Mare, 
extending inland, when danger threatens, into the 
valley beyond". Floods, mudslides and other natu-
ral dangers, forced many of the local population 
back into the comparative safety of the inland val-
ley and the surrounding hillsides. Many wealthy 
Roman families built their luxurious villas here, 
especially around the village now known as San 
Cesareo, to take advantage of the beautiful coun-
tryside and temperate climate that the area offered. 
It is also probable that the other local name for the 
area, the Metellia Valley, is derived from its Ro-
man links to the consul Quinto Cecilio Metellio, 
who maintained a large villa close by.
