Insects, especially butterflies, and animals of prey 
are to be found in abundance in the Park. The 
symbol of the park is the Macaone is an elegant, 
multi-coloured butterfly, whose presence during 
the months of Spring and Summer attract hundreds 
of visitors. The commonest birds-of- prey to be 
seen are buzzards, peregrine falcons, and in the 
woodland areas, the sparrow-hawk. Whilst the 
drumming sound emanating from the chestnuts is a 
constant reminder of the presence of the green 
woodpecker. Others to be found are the Greater 
Red and the Creeping Woodpecker. Birds of prey 
regularly nest and hunt in the Park, with the calls 
of resident nocturnal species, such as the tawny-
owl, the horned-owl and the barn-owl, ringing out 
across the mountains at night. Among the large 
numbers of smaller birds that inhabit the park are 
sparrows, wagtails, blackcaps and chaffinches and 
other finches. The Park is also a stopping point for 
certain migrating birds, such as cranes – the most 
beautiful of all the European birds – hoopoe, and 
cuckoo, as well as home to at least two pairs of 
Imperial Crows. Mammals to be found in the Park 
include badger, hedgehog, mole, beech-marten, 
fox, weasel, wild-boar, and hare.
