Around the year 1000 AD, the area where the park 
now stands was donated to the Monastery of Badia 
by the Lombard Prince Gisulfo II. In the fifteenth 
century, with the promotion of Cava to city-status, 
and the diminution of the once all-powerful Abbey 
of Santissima Trinità, increasing rivalry occurred 
over territorial control of the valley of Cava; the 
ownership of the area of Diecimare was one point 
of contention between these two local rivals. A 
declaration of 23 March 1580 decreed that the 
Bishops would have sole right to pasture over the 
land of Diecimare, whilst the Comune (City) of 
Cava would have sole right to the gathering of 
wood. As one commentator of the time noted,  the 
area “of higher ground is stoney, while the lower 
ground is covered in small trees.”. Around 1700, 
the inhabitants of the nearby village of Santa Lucia 
tried to cultivate the valley of Diecimare by tilling 
the woodland area, causing severe landslides as 
soon as the first rains fell. Work was halted imme-
diately and, under orders from the Monastery, the 
locals were forced to replant the parts of the valley 
that they had just cleared. With the partial dises-
tablishment of the Church following the Risorgi-
mento, in 1866 that part of the Diecimare that once 
belonged to the Monastery was transferred to the 
State. In 1916, the last specimen of local wild cat 
was killed. Today, following abuse of the natural 
resources of the area, a part has been set aside to 
create a Nature Park.
