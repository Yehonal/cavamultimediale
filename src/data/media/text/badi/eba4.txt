The splendid eighteenth century room, that now 
houses the Museum, was only discovered after 
the Second World War, previously having lain 
hidden from view by other buildings in the com-
plex. The vault has been rebuilt, the original win-
dows are missing and cannot be replaced, but the 
rest of this splendid example of eighteenth cen-
tury architecture is original. It was part of a 
building, used as guest accommodation, which 
stood separate and away from the Monastery. 
Another room next-door, of almost identical di-
mensions, collapsed at the beginning of this cen-
tury, but another immense room, upon which 
these two other rooms were built, still exists to-
day on the ground floor. Thanks must go in equal 
part to both Mons. Mauro De Caro, the Abbot of 
Badia at the time, and Prof. Bruno Molajoni, So-
printendente alle Gallerie of Campania, who di-
rected the architect, Ezio de Felice, and Prof. 
Ferdinando Bologna, in the construction and or-
ganisation of the Museum collection.
