Close to Monte Castello can be found the pleasant 
village of Santissima Annunziata, that takes its 
name from the local church dedicated to the Virgin 
Mary. It includes the local “Serra”, with its pine-
woods and ancient church of Santa Maria al Toro. 
Annunziata is popular with tourists and pilgrims 
from all over Italy, many coming to visit the “Little 
Lourdes”, a small replica of the famous French 
sanctuary, with its spring. At the centre of the old 
square of Annunziata there is a monument to the 
Fallen of two World Wars.
