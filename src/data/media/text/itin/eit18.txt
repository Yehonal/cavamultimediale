The village of Castagneto, standing at the top of 
the Bonea Valley that extends down to Vietri, gets 
its’ name from the chestnut woods that once 
stretched over the area. The beauty of the area in-
spired a nineteenth century poet, Paolina Craven 
(after whom is named a road that crosses the vil-
lage, next to the Villa Cardinale) to want to buy a 
house in the locality. Paolina De La Ferronays, of 
French origin, married Augusto Craven, a British 
diplomat at the Embassy in Naples, and often vis-
ited the City of Cava with her friend Teresa Filan-
gieri Rayaschieri. So enamoured with the City and 
its settings she wrote “there is nowhere so pictur-
esque and quiet as Cava. Bless the Lord for this 
place in such splendid natural surroundings.…I 
love all that this enchanting area has to offer, I 
could not dream of anywhere else.
