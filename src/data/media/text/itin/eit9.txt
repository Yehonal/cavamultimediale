Corpo di Cava is situated to the southwest of Cava, 
some four kilometres away, nestling in the hills 
around the Abbey of Badia. Once boasting a 
population of over nine hundred people in medie-
val times, this was reduced dramatically first by 
the growth of the City of Cava, in the fifteenth 
century, and then with the rise of urbanisation in 
southern Italy, following the nineteenth-century 
Risorgimento. Its' name "Corpo" (literally, "body") 
originates from when the town was first developed 
under the eleventh century Abbots of Badia, and 
was where the administrators for the Church lands, 
owned and managed by the Abbey, lived.
