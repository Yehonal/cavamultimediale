On the mountains to the southeast of Cava, lies the 
village of Dupino. According to Canon Alberto de 
Filippis, the village was called after "Tupino", the 
homeland of San Ubaldo, who is venerated at the 
little church on Monte San Liberatore, close to the 
village of Santissima Quaranta, on the old moun-
tain road to Salerno. "Tupino" took its name from a 
small chapel that was built to commemorate some 
forty saints martyred along with San Sebaste (Saint 
Sebastian). The cult was introduced into the area 
by Armenian monks in early medieval times. An-
other, possibly more plausible, if less colourful, 
reason for the origin of the name is that of "Quar-
ante", the name of a local family that had its seat in 
the area.
