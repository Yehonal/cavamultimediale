On the slopes of the Lattari Hills, which rise to a 
height of 377 metres, and overlooking the valley of 
Cava and the plain of Nocera, is the old Monastery 
of San Martino. The Monastery, which is men-
tioned in records of the tenth century, was given by 
Lombard princes to the Abbot of the Holy Trinity, 
Badia, was turned into a hospital by the Benedic-
tines, remaining as such until the sixteenth century. 
It was abandoned after the earthquake of 1980, and 
is now in urgent need of structural restoration. 
From its terraces one can see the whole of the val-
ley of Cava, from the west as far round as the 
Mount San Liberatore and the circle of green 
slopes that run down to the edge of the Bay of 
Salerno.
