Built before the year 1000 AD, the Church of the 
Holy San Salvatore was given in 1088 AD to the 
Benedictine Monastery of the Holy Trinity in 
Cava, then under the control of the powerful Abbot 
Pietro, by a certain Rolagrina, wife of Costantino 
Jocantella. In 1149, Pope Eugenio III confirmed 
that the Church was the property of Badia, an act 
that was endorsed nine years later in 1158 by Ales-
sandro III. The Church was sited originally on the 
Cava-Tramonti road, facing north and overlooking 
the valley, but in 1747 was re-sited by Antonio 
Buongiorno so that it faced east. This effectively 
reduced the size of the Church, but retained three 
large and spacious naves. The work of greatest 
note in the Church is the large altar, dedicated to 
Our Saviour, constructed of precious marble and 
overhung by a large painting of Jesus.
