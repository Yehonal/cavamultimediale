"In the village of San Adiutore one can enjoy the 
pleasures of the beautiful monastery of the Capu-
chin Fathers, with its Church of Santa Maria degli 
Angioli (literally, "of the Angels"), built on the 
breast of the hill where is sited our celebrated Cas-
tle of San Adiutore". So wrote the historian Pol-
verino, in 1715. Polverino was referring to 16 
April 1566, when the Council of the City of Cava, 
invited the Capuchins to purchase the land of 
Marco Orilia so as to establish their Monastery in 
the city. "Everyone was so excited when they saw, 
in 1575, that all was done". The chapel, the work 
of the local architect, Pignoloso Cafaro, was dedi-
cated to Santa Maria degli Angioli, whose effigy 
stood on the High Altar. Inside, the chapel was 
decorated with rich workings in wood, such as the 
little tabernacle with its statues of San Francesco 
and San Antonio di Padua. The side altars were 
built at a later period, the first being dedicated to 
San Felice di Cantalice, from whom derives the 
name of the Monastery. (It is said that this saint, 
known as the Patron of Snow, received thanks 
through processions and gifts from the Capuchin 
monks every time that the snow fell heavily on the 
ground). Another altar is dedicated to the Cruci-
fixion, and holds the burial chambers of the Ta-
lamo-Atenolfi family. The cloisters are not of a 
regular design, being built around a typical local 
water-well. The area was previously known as "Piè 
la Selva" (literally, "Foot of the Tree"), and was 
popular for the hunting of migrant birds. Indeed, as 
commented Notargiacomo in 1831, "In order to 
remove noisy hunters from the area, the City 
Council of Cava bought a piece of land from a 
certain G. A. Orilia in 1585…."
