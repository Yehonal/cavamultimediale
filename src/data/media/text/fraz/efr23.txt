On 5 September 1092, Pope Urban II (whose 
statue now stands in the piazza in front of the ab-
bey at Badia) came to the Benedictine Monastery 
of the Holy Trinity of Badia for the ceremony of 
consecration. On the approach to Badia from Cava, 
it is said, Pope Urban II decided to dismount from 
his horse and walk the final short distance up the 
hill to the newly enlarged Abbey. Whilst walking, 
he stopped at a large boulder, declaring to his reti-
nue that a chapel should be built on the spot where 
the boulder lay. Today, visitors can still see this 
boulder, the Pietra Santa, now lying inside the 
chapel built upon his command, and enlarged into 
a small church in 1626. Inside the church, which 
today lies desolate, there is an inscription recording 
the meeting of Pope Urban II and third Abbot of 
Badia, Pietro, once fellow monks at the grand Ab-
bey of Cluny, in France, headquarters of the Bene-
dictine Order. The view from this point is one of 
the finest in the area, overlooking the valley of 
Cava, and stretching south and east over the Bay of 
Salerno.
