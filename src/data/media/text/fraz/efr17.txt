Cava has been famous since before the eighteenth 
century for its beautiful villas.Among the most 
beautiful of its villas - although certainly not one 
of its most historic - is that of the Ricciardi family, 
given to the "Nostra Famiglia" (literally, "Our 
Family") Foundation in 1973. Situated on the sce-
nic Via Marghieri, outside the main town, and 
facing east towards the sea, it was constructed 
between 1876 and 1883, along with many similar 
grand houses under the supervision of the Trara-
Genoino administration. The Ricciardi family only 
took over the villa in the 1930s. It has also been a 
hotel - "The Britannia" - attracting foreign visitors, 
especially British, who came to the area. In the 
1930s, the garden was redesigned and decorated 
with Vietri ceramics, as well as being provided 
with an irrigation system. The park around the villa 
slopes steeply down to the road below, the villa 
being built of red brick and surrounded by large 
terraces, the trees in the park providing comple-
mentary colour and shape. A marvellous backdrop 
being provided by the lush colours of Mount San 
Liberatore and the blue, blue sea. The "Nostra 
Famiglia" Centre for Handicapped Children has 
been in operation since 1976, and has charge of the 
surrounding parklands, where it has given permis-
sion to establish a small local centre for the ad-
ministration of the local parish. The stylish large 
houses in the nearby village of Rotolo (Villa Gal-
ise, Ferrari, Marghieri, etc) also enjoy the benefits 
of wonderful natural countryside and scenery, built 
as they are upon hills looking toward Cava and the 
sea. Many famous guests have visited Cava, indeed 
when the poet Giorgio Seferis lived here in 1944 
with the Greek Government-in-exile, he sang of 
"…The splendid moonlit nights in this Tyrrhenian 
village, of the sea of Salerno, and the portal of their 
return….".
