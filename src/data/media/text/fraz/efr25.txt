The Church of Santa Maria Maggiore was conse-
crated in 1092, following thirteen years of con-
struction. At the time it was also known as the 
Church of Santa Maria della Terra (literally, "of 
the Land") because, according to the historian Pol-
verino, it was built on land donated to Badia by the 
Princes of Salerno. For a brief period, it also acted 
as the Cathedral for the diocese of Amalfi-Cava, 
until the Bishop's Palace was removed to the 
Borgo Grande (literally, "Big Town") in Cava, in 
the valley below. Constructed on the traditional 
three-nave design, its builders took much inspira-
tion and material from the local ruins, including 
some Roman capitals dating back to the Imperial 
Age. Inside, of note is the Benedictine monument 
(which has undergone a number of transformations 
throughout its history, the most telling being that 
of the seventeenth century) and a beautiful stucco 
wood statue dated 1617, by Carrozza, of the 
Vergine Assunta.
