The little Church of the Madonna del Ponte (liter-
ally, "of the Bridge"), also known as the Church of

of some of the most famous painters of the eight-
eenth century.  It was built in 1735 upon the site of 
a shrine dedicated to, and decorated by a fresco of, 
the Madonna del Carmine. Octagonal in shape, 
with the remains of tiled flooring, one can still en-

one can also view a painting of the "Immacolata", 
signed and dated 1736. The Church also acts as the 
parish church for the district.
