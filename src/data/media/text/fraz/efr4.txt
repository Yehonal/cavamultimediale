Next to the eighteenth century Church of the Ma-
donna del Carmine can be found the beautiful Ba-
roque Fountain of Cava which, until a few years 
ago, was in a poor state of repair. Today, thanks to 
restoration work done by "Italia Nostra" in 1993, 
the visitor can once more appreciate the baroque 
beauty of the fountain, constructed of local dark 
grey tufo stone and decorated with friezes and 
flutings.
