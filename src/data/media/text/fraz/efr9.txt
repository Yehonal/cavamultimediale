In autumn, in the shade of the woods that cloak the 
western slopes of hills to the east of Cava, hunters 
have traditionally played "il gioco dei colombi" 
(literally, "the pigeon game"), using giant nets to 
catch the migrating pigeons. Like at "La Serra", 
tall stone towers dot the villages of Arco (where a 
famous local field-sports festival grew up in the 
nineteenth century), Campitello, and Borrello. 
These were favourite haunts of hunters and spec-
tators alike, and it was here that they would meet 
every hunting season. The best preserved of the 
towers, used to spot approaching birds, can be 
found at Arco, where there is an inscription with 
the date "AD 1721", probably signifying when re-
structuring work was completed. From these tow-
ers, the "partitari" would redirect the oncoming 
birds towards the large nets. The area, once famous 
for its thick woods, its ancient trees, and its peace-
ful countryside, has not been spoiled by the arrival 
of the modern age. Even today, a visitor can stum-
ble across an old "partitari" tower, half-hidden by 
vegetation, and discover anew a piece of local 
history.
