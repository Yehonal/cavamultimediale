The Church of Santa Maria della Purificazione is 
now abandoned following, according to local par-
ish records, Allied bombing and German heavy 
gunfire, "without thought for the beauty and maj-
esty of the building". It last suffered damage in the 
earthquake of 1980, and is still prey to the activi-
ties to local thieves. Inside, and still remaining 
relatively unharmed from the sixteenth century, is 
the tomb of Abbot Pascasio, restored along with 
fifteenth century Vetranto sculptures, thanks to 
contributions from the local Azienda Autonoma di 
Soggiorno e Turismo. These sculptures are of 
Traiano Civitella, and also of The Madonna and 
Child, attributed to Giovanni da Nola. These items 
can now be found in the Palazzo Vescovile 
(Bishop's Palace). The tomb of Abbot Pascasio is 
perhaps most important for its reference to monas-
tic activities during the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries. The tombstone notes the Abbot's death 
in 1554 and depicts a hermit, surrounded by 
mountains, in prayer, meditation, and performing 
good works to the sick and passing pilgrims. A 
restoration might return the Church to its original 
fifteenth century splendour, for inside can be found 
three naves, restructured at the end of the seven-
teenth century in Baroque style, as well the dome 
which rises above a cylindrical "tamburo" con-
taining square openings bordered with grey tufo.
