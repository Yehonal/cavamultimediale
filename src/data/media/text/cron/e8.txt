The Cavese initially joined the Aragon cause because it was believed that it would 
assist the City in shaking off the control exerted by the Monastery of Badia. In fact 
the Cavese took to heart so much the Aragon cause that they were soon decorated 
with the title “Most Faithful” from their Spanish overlords. But siding with the 
Aragon princes also brought with it involvement with powerful and opposing 
forces outside the small world of Cava. When Ferdinand I of Aragon encountered 
an army of supporters of John of Anjou, son of Renato, bent on retaking his south-
ern Italian lands, he was joined by five hundred Cavese soldiers who turned appar-
ent imminent defeat into victory. Led by Giosuè and Marino Longo, the local sol-
diers arrived at Sarno just in time to save the day for the Aragon forces. For this 
reason, the Aragon king gave to the people and City of Cava one of the highest re-
wards possible: the celebrated “blank” charter, accompanied by a letter. Sixteen 
days later, on the 22 September 1460, the king sent other concessions to the City, 
including the right to unify the coat-of-arms of the City with that of the Royal 
House of Aragon: two bars - one red, the other gold – crowned). Needless to say, 
the Cavese chose not to put down on the “blank” charter their requests, an to this 
day the charter remains in pride of place at the Town Hall of Cava. All privileges 
granted to the City were respected by subsequent Aragon and Spanish rulers - such 
as exemption from the payment of duties on their products (whether buying or 
selling) and any other, often spurious, taxation that might from time to time be ap-
plied – and held true for the whole of the Neapolitan region, excepting the City of 
Naples itself, where the Cavese were accorded the same rights as the citizens of 
Naples.
