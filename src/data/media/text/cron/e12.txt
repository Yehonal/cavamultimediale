Abbot Don Crisostomo de Alessandro accepts the citizens of Cava’s request that 
the City has the right to host its own episcopate. This acknowledgement is a bitter 
blow to the power and prestige of Badia, as the Abbey loses a number of its most 
important possessions, including that of the small port of Vietri, in the ensuing 
boundary changes.  Following the issue of a Papal Bull by Leo X, on 22 March 
1513, recognising the new ‘status quo’, the Abbey of Badia loses its jurisdiction 
over the City of Cava. The loss was greatly felt by the monks who, possibly under 
the direct orders of Abbot Severino Boccia (1672-1677), inscribed a memorial slab 
and placed it on the boundary between the City of Cava and the territory of the Ab-
bey, at the start of via Santa Margherita in Corpo di Cava declaring in latin “To 
God. This stone marks the now small boundaries of what was once a great land-
holding assigned to the holy and ancient Monastery at Cava by the generosity of 
the Popes. However, don’t be dismayed by the smallness of the two, the land and 
the Monastery. For all those living under the Moon, to perish is a law not a penalty. 
By its claws, however, you measure the lion! Go in health!
