On 3 April, Joseph Buonaparte stopped at Vietri en route to Padula. He was re-
ceived in Vietri by the Marquis Loffredo. He also visited Badia, where he spoke 
with the Abbot (who happened to be speak excellent French) on matters concerning 
the welfare of the poor, and offered a number of concessions to the Monastery. 
Following a Decree issued on 15 September 1806, Vietri was separated from Cava 
and elevated to the rank of an independent Comune, with authority over the vil-
lages of Arcara, Marini, Alessia, Santi Quaranta, Dupino, Anna, Casaburi, Casta-
gneto, Dragonea, Molina, Benincasa, Raito, Albori e Cetara. This was the final 
blow to the once-proud City of Cava which, while it consisted of the three major 
centres of Cava, Cetara, and Vietri had survived bad times, and prospered in good.
