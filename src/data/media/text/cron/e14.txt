The City of Cava, and its surrounding territory is harassed not only by land but also 
by sea. Its two ports of Vietri and Cetara suffer attacks from raiding Corsairs that 
have for centuries attacked ships and coastal towns throughout the Mediterranean. 
During the overlordship of the Spanish, Southern Italy suffered more than usually, 
possibly due to the lack of direct intervention due to the absence of a resident king, 
as well as the continuing waging of sporadic warfare between the French and the 
Spanish. It was quite possible also, that the Corsairs were encouraged in their ac-
tivities by enemies of Carlos V.
