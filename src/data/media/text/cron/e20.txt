Duke Arcos, Viceroy to the Spanish throne in the Kingdom of  Naples, under re-
quests for money from Madrid to maintain war in Europe, imposes new taxes on 
foodstuffs. The foodstuffs most hit are fruit and vegetables, the two foodstuffs that 
comprise the major part of the local diet. Disturbances followed, the most notable 
being that led by Massaniello, a twenty-four year old fishmonger from Amalfi, and 
two citizens of Cava, Don Giulio Genoino and Marco Vitale  who, for a brief mo-
ment, showed the local people what power they held, only to be quickly betrayed 
by their fellow-countrymen. The citizens of Cava, who were closely involved in the 
revolt, generally sided with their traditional Spanish masters, whilst the Monastery 
of Badia and its adherents supported the ill-fated Massaniello.
